# free-parking

`free-parking` is a lightweight, free, open-source Next.js/React/Tailwind template for quickly spinning up "domain for sale" landing pages, cutting out the need for services like Afternic. Created by [@baileysimrell](https://github.com/baileysimrelll) of [@justrightpl](https://jutright.pl).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/chat).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
